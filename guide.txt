# Quick Start Commands

First time setup:
pnpm setup

Run both backend and frontend together:
pnpm dev

Run individually:
Backend only: pnpm backend:dev
Frontend only: pnpm frontend:dev

# Port Configuration
Frontend (Next.js): PORT=3000 (customizable in .env)
Backend (Express): BACKEND_PORT=4004 (customizable in .env)

To change ports, edit .env file:
- PORT=3000 (frontend)
- BACKEND_PORT=4004 (backend)
- Update CORS_ORIGIN accordingly

# Production Build
npm run build

# Database Setup
pnpm install
npx prisma migrate dev --name AuditDB

# Seed Database (TypeScript files are used)
pnpm seed:actions      # Seed action types (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
pnpm seed:auditlogs    # Seed 60 sample audit log records for testing
pnpm seed:all          # Seed both action types and audit logs (recommended)

Note: 
- Run seed:actions first before seed:auditlogs (or use seed:all)
- seed:all now includes 60+ audit log records for development/testing
- API key seeder is excluded from seed:all (apiKey model doesn't exist in schema)
